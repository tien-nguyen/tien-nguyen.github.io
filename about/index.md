Welcome!

I decided to move my personal site and some of my codes from mecurial to git. I will use this space to convey my thoughts and notes about the topics mentioned below. I also like to discover unexpected regularity thus comes the name (thanks my wife for brainstorming). It will take me sometime to migrate all of my thoughts and notes onto this site. 

## Topics:

* Algorithms.
* Data Science.
* My research.
* Technologies.
* and other topics that I feel it's worth to jot down.
