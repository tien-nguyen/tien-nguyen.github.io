I decided to move my personal site and some of my codes from mecurial to git. This site contains notes and thoughts of my own. These notes and thoughts do not reflect the opinions of companies I've worked for or of schools I'm affiliated with. 


It would take me sometime to migrate all of my thoughts and notes onto this site. However, along the way you will see my posts cover the following topics (which are of my interests).

## Topics:

* Algorithms.
* Data Science.
* My research.
* Technologies.
* and other topics that I feel it's worth to jot down.
