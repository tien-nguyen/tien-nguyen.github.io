Whenever I used R for my data analyses, I had to write a lot of codes to manipulate my data, and sometimes the codes cannot be maintainable.  Thanks to dplyr and tidyr packages I no logner need to write long and redundant codes. This blog is where I write some tricks of using dplyr and tidyr. 

If you want to have a head-start, you can read these blogs [^1,^2]. The cheat-sheat can be found here [^3].
